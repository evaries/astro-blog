Hello, long time no see! I am glad to have you here. Yes, I've started writing again, and I'm a bit excited and elated about it. Below, I'll share more about what you can expect to see here, as well as my motivation and goals. So here we go, I'll try not to delay it.

**Why did I start writing again?** I created my first blog in 2021, it's still alive and can be found [here](https://move-more.live/). It had one simple theme: a new habit every week. I ran it for exactly one year. That's 52 weeks. Of course, I didn't manage to stick to all 52 habits, but I learned some important lessons. The first is the habits themselves. A significant number of them have stayed with me to this day. The second is the experience and patterns of forming these habits. They all follow the same rules, only the context changes. This is a very interesting topic, and I'll talk about it separately one day. Third, I learned a lot during this experiment because I had to understand perfectly how this or that process works, what nuances are important, and what I should get in the end. The hours of research and information searching broadened my horizons significantly. Fourthly, the audio recordings of my posts have improved my diction and clarity of speech. The list is long enough to keep doing it again. Now I have a somewhat more global, but also vague, goal. I want to learn to write _interesting_. I want to learn how to formulate my thoughts, organize them into paragraphs, and create easy-to-read texts. Furthermore, I want to improve my storytelling and rhetoric skills, and thus become an interesting person to talk to. As you can imagine, there are many reasons to resume blogging, and that's why it happened.

**What will I write about?** The main goal is still self-development and self-education in all aspects and projects that interest me. From forming new habits and acquiring skills to creating my own projects. I plan to describe this entire path. Along the way, I will create some roadmaps and summaries so that you can also benefit from my experience if necessary. The topics will vary and I will experiment with them, but right now I have this rough list in mind:

- **Web development.** This is my job and my hobby. I am very glad that my profession brings me pleasure and I want to do programming in my free time. The world of development is developing rapidly, and before you know it, some new technology is released. That's because this is IT. In order to stay relevant as a developer, you need to constantly learn and be in context. As part of my studies, I plan to create my own mini-projects to solve my tasks and describe the process, experience, and final product. Creating this website you are looking at now is one of them.
- **Health.** This is a big topic that should be of interest to everyone. No matter how pumped up your soul and mind are, they live in your body. And it has a tendency to rot. And in order not to fall apart in your 40s, you need to take care of it. For me, it's a separate universe with its own galaxies: sports, nutrition, regimen, sleep, and a bunch of other things. I will try something new, talk about what I have already acquired and become even better.
- **Self-development** is another very interesting and endless topic for me. You just don't realize how much you can change your life by changing your attitude to things and events around you. The topic is deep and the more you dig into it, the more treasures you find. And how many other interesting things are on the surface.
- **Lifestyle** is a rather conditional generalization of everything that did not fall into the previous categories. Things that have outgrown the stage of habit and are so firmly rooted in life that they have become an integral part of it.

The site will have a tagged section, so you can filter articles and find the ones that are right for you.

**How often will you post?** I plan to write once a week. Maybe more often, maybe less often. I don't have a clear framework for myself at the moment. The format and frequency can also change and adapt. This is just an initial plan, and it can be adjusted. And one more innovation: I plan to run text-based social networks, i.e. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/y_nadtochii) and the newly fashionable [Threds](https://www.threads.net/@e.nadtochiy). I will post my thoughts and processes behind the scenes of writing this blog.

These are my plans and expectations. If you find this interesting, subscribe to some social networks, they will have announcements. I'm happy to be back on the keyboard, so to be continued, stay tuned.
